Description: REDItools: python scripts for RNA editing detection by RNA-Seq data
        ===================================================================
        
        Introduction
        ============
        REDItools are python scripts developed with the aim to study RNA editing at genomic scale
        by next generation sequencing data. RNA editing is a post-transcriptional phenomenon
        involving the insertion/deletion or substitution of specific bases in precise RNA localizations.
        In human, RNA editing occurs by deamination of cytosine to uridine (C-to-U) or mostly by the
        adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) conversion through ADAR enzymes. A-to-I substitutions may have
        profound functional consequences and have been linked to a variety of human diseases including
        neurological and neurodegenerative disorders or cancer. Next generation sequencing technologies
        offer the unique opportunity to investigate in depth RNA editing even though no dedicated
        software has been released up to now.
        
        REDItools are simple python scripts conceived to facilitate the investigation of RNA editing
        at large-scale and devoted to research groups that would to explore such phenomenon in own
        data but donâ€™t have sufficient bioinformatics skills.
        They work on main operating systems (although unix/linux-based OS are preferred), can handle reads from whatever
        platform in the standard BAM format and implement a variety of filters.
